Preface
A note about language
Discussions of Information Communications Technology often refer to Free Software or Open Source Software. These terms are commonly used interchangeably, and indeed, their official published definitions differ very little from one another. For convenience, some writers merge the two terms and speak of FOSS or Free and Open Source Software, or use the term FLOSS to clarify that by "free" they mean "libre" (and not merely "gratis").
Because we, as progressive technologists, care deeply about the freedom of the people we support (including ourselves), we choose to use the term Free Software in this book. Free Software is about Freedom, not just visible source code or zero cost, and we believe freedom is an important goal. For a better understanding of why software freedom is important, please read the chapter by Amanda Hickman in this book. For more reading, and the official definitions of these specific terms, please visit http://fsf.org/ and http://opensource.org/

Acknowledgments
This book was a collaborative project that involves more than the authors of the articles. Special thanks in particular to Mark Libkuman and Josue Guillen for reviewing the content, Jack Aponte, Nat Meysenburg and Jon Lorusso for copy-editing and everybody at the open staff meetings of May First/People Link for contributing to the shape of the book. The ideas in this book arise from countless discussions and ongoing activities involving the people who develop, shape, organize and are part of the Internet. They are, in essence, its authors.
